# Howdy!

I'm Aros Ontiveros (s8lt), a Senior Cybersecurity Student at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I'm very passionate about gaining skills in the Cybersecurity field and achieving my passion of becoming a Security Engineer. I recently completed a internship in the Summer of 2024 as a Cybersecurity Intern with the Texas Workforce Commission office in Austin, Tx. I gained skills in vulnerability assessments, risk assessments, risk documentaion and GRC frameworks. I am looking forward to improving my skills as I continue to utilize resources online to further my skills including HTB, CyberDefenders and Let's Defend. Using this website, I will take you along with me on the journey of learning these new skills and further improving my existing skillset
